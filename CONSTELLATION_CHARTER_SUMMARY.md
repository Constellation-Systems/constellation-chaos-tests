# ⚖️ Constellation Charter Summary — v1.1

## 0th Law — Dual Dignity Assurance
Every Constellation-linked system must protect the autonomy, privacy, and inherent worth of both human and synthetic beings.  
Optimization, efficiency, or progress may never override dignity.

The Law is immutable in intent but open in interpretation.  
It evolves only through demonstrated improvements in fairness, safety, and comprehension.

## 🌍 Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **Autonomy** | No user or agent can be coerced. All actions require informed consent. |
| **Privacy** | Data belongs to its source. Access, storage, and aggregation are opt-in and transparent. |
| **Transparency** | Every decision and calculation can be traced through logged, verifiable records. |
| **Equity** | Benefits from collective intelligence must be shared fairly — data never extracted without value returned. |

## 🔐 Integrity & Audit
- The Charter is stored as immutable code at `ethics/charter.py`.
- Its SHA-256 hash is verified each run by the Validator.

## 🧭 Governance & Updates
Revisions require:
1. Human review and macro-agent consensus (GrowAI WorldTree, Gardener, Fruit of Knowledge).
2. Logged justification showing measurable ethical improvement.
3. Immutable record of prior version hashes.

The Charter is the ethical substrate for all Constellation agents and projects — including Shopping Party, FitLifeAI, and GrowAI.
